If we cat the file we can see thats a perl script who run at the port 4747.
And it's executing the script as the creator. So we need to make it execute getflag.
To do so, we use curl to send a request, and with may tries we figure how to pass param in the query.
So we finaly succed with this cmd : curl http://localhost:4747?x='$(getflag)'
