The file that said exploit me.
If we decompile the file we realise that is seting a group and a creator different.
And at the end at the function he is returning : return system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me");
So the return is executed by the creator of the file not the user.
So we can said that echo is = to /usr/bin/env.
For doing that we had a new path to /tmp and in /tmp we create an executable file called echo that will call getflag
and tadam :
flag =  qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
