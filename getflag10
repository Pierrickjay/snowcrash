We dissablle the executable file and we realize it s client that need to connect to a serv.
So we created the serv present in main_10.c. But when we tried to pass token to ./level10 he did connect to the serv but we didn t have access to token so didn't work.

We searched online for exploit on access and we realise it's possible to switch between to file with symlink.
The idea is to execute level10 with our link pointing to the authorize file and switching it with the token file while
level10 is running. In doing so, we were able to bypass acces and open file not authorize and read the token file.

token : woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
flag : feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
