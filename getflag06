We saw 2 files at the root with the same system that flag06 is going to execute it.
We understood that we need to make level06 call getflag. We dissamble it and we saw
that it was executing level06.php. After we try to see if there was any exploit in
the .php file. We saw that /e was a famous exploit for the preg_replace function.
so we finally found this command :
echo '/([x .{${system(getflag)}}@])' > /tmp/testphp
./level06 /tmp/testphp
Flag = wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
