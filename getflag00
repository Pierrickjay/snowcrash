In the intra video the find Word is in capslock.
So we try to find in the racine with flag00 as a creator :
find / -user flag00 -print 2>/dev/full
And we can see that there are a lot of permission denied
but if we inspect not all of them are permission denied
for exemple /usr/sbin/john
if we cat /usr/sbin/john we got : cdiiddwpgswtgt
In the intra video they talk about dcode. So we try with it with a simple cesar Decode
We ask to try everything and with a shift if 11 we got nottoohardhere

mdp : nottoohardhere
token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
