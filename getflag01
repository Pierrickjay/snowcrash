cat /etc/password
We can see that the password is not encrypted for flag01.
But if you try to connect with it, it doesn't work !
So we will need to use the john the reaper hacking tool (We know that was john to use thanks to level00)
mdp before decrypt with john :42hDRfypTqqnw
mdp AFTER :abcdefg
flag01:f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
