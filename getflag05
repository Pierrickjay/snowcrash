So when we log for the first time we can see we have a new mail.
weird
And if we can see everyfile that flag05 can execute with the commande :
find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null
We find a program that is executing everyfile present in the repository : /opt/openarenaserver/*
But this programe can only be executed by flag05.
So the idea is to put getflag inside the directory : /opt/openarenaserver/ and execute it.
Which we did and we realize that 2s afters we got token. Hum weird again.
But if we look more about how the mails works in linux, we go to /var/mail and we can see a crontab configuration file that is executing the program with a sudo priviledge.
