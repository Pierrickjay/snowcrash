We saw that in the decompile that the function was calling getuid. So our idea was to create a function: getuid
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <unistd.h>

uid_t getuid(void) {
    // Replace the original getuid() logic with your custom implementation
    return 4242; // Return the desired UID
}

After that we create a lib.so with this file and we use this lib to compile our program.
to do inside the /var/crash :
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libgetuid_override.so getuid.c -ldl
then put this lib as a default lib :
export LD_PRELOAD=/var/crash/libgetuid_override.so

then if we execute just like this and doesn't work but if we try with gdb it does work.
